# Mobile-Gait-Performance
A Mobile app that assesses gait performance of patients' with Parkinson's Disease

## Description of the Project
Title : Design a mobile App that assess patient gait performance
Parkinson’s  disease  is  the  second  most  common  neurodegenerative  condition  globally,  affecting millions  of  individuals.  Clinicians  frequently  employ  functional  mobility  assessments,  such  as  the Timed Up and Go test and the Five-times Sit to Stand test to evaluate a patient’s mobility. The Timed Up and Go test entails standing up from a chair, walking forward 3-metres, turning 180-degrees and returning  to  the  chair.  The  Five-times  Sit  to  Stand  test  entails  standing  up  from  a  seated  position, repeated   five   times.      For   visual   demonstration,   you   may   refer   to   the   following   video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grrYoBucNPE. These  assessments  help  clinicians  screen  for  people  at  risk  of  mobility  problems,  monitor  existing patients’ progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed interventions. Typically, the assessor must manually time the performance in the functional mobility assessment with a stopwatch while ensuring the safety of the person being assessed. To improve both patient and clinician's experience, a mobile app is to be developed that supports the automated assessment to automatically monitor and assess patient's gait performance in a recorded video.

## Final Deliverables of the Project
The mobile app should display the output of the automated assessment system, providing necessary information to both patients and clinician. The application overall should offer and interactive and visual platform that allows patients to track their rehabilitation progress and for clinicians to easily monitor patients' advancement in details.

## Goals of the app
- [ ] Display Output of Automated Assessment System
- [ ] Provide Necessary Information to both patients and clinicians
- [ ] Interactive Visual Platform to allow both patients and clinicians to easily track/monitor patient advancement/rehabilitation progress in detail.
